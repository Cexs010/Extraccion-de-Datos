I love getting outdoors, whether it's working at home, walking the dogs or going bushwalking in our beautiful national parks.  I enjoy a regular yoga practice and continue to put myself out of my comfort zone by training with a karate group, ....... who said ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks"" !!!!

Tasmania has so many ""hidden gems"" to discover and I hope to spend more time travelling locally in the next few years.  I'm Tasmanian-born but continue to be amazed by what I've not seen before then stumble across.    When the time is right I'd love to head overseas again,  for another European adventure or trek the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu.
